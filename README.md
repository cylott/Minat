# Minat

**Minat** is a lightweight, multithreaded transcoder for Mac OS. Minat supports one operation: transcoding flac to mp3, preserving tags and album artwork. Written in PHP, Minat is lightweight and easy to modify.

Support is planned for two other operations:

* Generate specs from audio files supported by sox
* Rename folders based on the tags of the audio files inside

* **â‡© [Download Minat 0.1.4](https://github.com/)**
